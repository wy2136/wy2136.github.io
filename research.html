        <p>My research is focused on better understanding climate variability and change on broad timescales of sub-seasons to millennia, as well as why the mean climate of the planet is the way it is. 
Interests are also in the impact of climate variability and change beyond the climate system, e.g. the epidemic dynamics.
In particular, I am interested in the moisture component within climate since water is not only important in global energy budget but also greatly influencing the environment of our planet and lives inside.</p>

        <p>Geographically, my work covers a wide range of regions from semi-arid land areas to intensive-rainfall oceans in the tropics,  and from middle latitudes where the weather is greatly impacted by large scale storms, to the Arctic where the sea ice has been declining significantly in recent decades.</p>

        <p>I analyze various sources of large datasets from observations, reanalysis, and output from climate models and also use both complex and idealized climate models to understand the mechanisms behind climate variability, change and impact.</p>

          </div>
		
          <p>How the climate responds to radiative forcing, particularly to the injection of sulfate aerosols, is an important question. 
Some of the largest volcanic events over the last century, have released up to 30 Tg (Pinatubo) of sulfate into the global stratosphere. 
Probing the impacts of these volcanic eruptions offers insights into how these explosive events impact components of the climate system, such as tropical cyclones, El Nino events, and Arctic Sea Ice. </p>

          <p>To improve our understanding of how the location of the volcanic eruption influences its climate impact, we use a coupled climate model (FLOR) to investigate the impacts of three eruptions (Pinatubo, Agung, and Santa Maria), which varied in their forcing: The Pinatubo eruption had largest sulfate loading with equal impacts in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, while Agung and Santa Maria had smaller sulfate loading with disproportionate impacts in the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively. 
Results build on previous studies that showed radiative forcing structure, beyond that of aerosol loading, impact global and regional temperature and precipitation.</p>
		  <p>We illustrate that Agung and Santa Maria (lower aerosol loadings) more strongly impacted Tropical Cyclone Activity and shifted the Tropical Cyclones and Intertropical Convergence Zone away from the hemisphere associated with the aerosol loading. 
Of the three volcanic eruptions, Pinatubo was by far the largest, with seven times more aerosol loading than Santa Maria, yet due to spatial forcing differences, Santa Maria resulted in the largest climate sensitivities.
The majority of current climate models do not accurately reconstruct the spatial structure of volcanic aerosols and therefore the disproportionate impacts of volcanic eruptions on regional scales, which lead to larger scale climate sensitivities as demonstrated by this study, are not represented in model output. 
This highlights that it is critical to take the spatial structure of volcanic aerosol radiative properties into account when climate models are used to ask questions such as – how have past volcanic eruptions impacted climate, especially when focusing on the hydroclimate and large scale phenomena. </p>

          <p>Moisture transport by the atmospheric circulation is a significant component of the global water cycle and is crucial in determining the distribution of global precipitation and influencing the energy budget.
          Recent studies suggest that springtime moisture transport into the Arctic can initiate sea ice melt that extends to a large area in the following summer and fall, which can help explain Arctic sea ice interannual variability.
          Yet the impact from an individual moisture transport event, especially the extreme ones, is unclear on synoptic to intraseasonal time scales.</p>

          <p>By applying a lag composite analysis on daily observations and reanalysis data, we demonstrated that extreme moisture transport in to the Arctic can reduce the sea ice concentration over the Greenland-Barents-Kara Seas via enhancing the surface downward thermal radiation.
          Of these extreme transport days, over 60% are associated with the Blocking weather regime over the North Atlantic.
          We also revealed that these extreme transport events might be preceded by convective heatings in the tropics by as long as two weeks.</p>

          <p>The Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a zonally elongated band of active convection and intensive rainfall, which is the dominant heating source of the atmosphere and highly impacts global atmospheric circulation and climate.
          The daily ITCZ in the east Pacific is most variable in March--April when it may be located north of equator (nITCZ), south of equator (sITCZ), both sides of equator (dITCZ), or it may be absent (aITCZ).
          The question is: Is there any relationship between the daily ITCZ categories and the background climate state over the Pacific? In particular, what kind of role does the \nino{}-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) play in the distribution of the daily ITCZ categories?</p>

          <p>Using a new dataset of ITCZ categories that are derived from sub-daily satellite images by applying sophisticated machine learning techniques, we performed composite analysis on various climate fields from reanalysis for different ITCZs.
          We found that the daily ITCZ categories are indeed modulated by the El Nino-La Nina phases, with the dITCZ corresponding to the central Pacific La Nina, a SST anomaly pattern similar to the traditional La Nina but with cool SST anomalies centered around the central Pacific (in stead of  the east Pacific).</p>

          </div>
		  
          <p>East Africa, the greater coastal region of the tropical western Indian Ocean, has a dry annual mean climatology and two rainy seasons with the major one during March--May (often called the "long rains") and the second one during October--December (the "short rains").
          Nearly half economy in this region is from agriculture, which is mainly rain-fed and highly vulnerable to climate variability and change.
          In addition, it is an interesting region in terms of climate science: much drier than other deep tropical land areas of the same latitude and a rainfall seasonal cycle being out of phase with that of the famous neighbor--the Asian monsoon (which has a single peak of rainfall in Summer).
          Therefore, the study of hydroclimate in East Africa is not only important in practice but also crucial in better understanding our climate system. </p>

          <p>In recent decades, East Africa has been undergoing increased frequency and intensity of droughts, threatening lives of millions of people in this hydrologically and politically vulnerable region.
          This trend is mainly due to the declining of the long rains.
          Recent studies demonstrated that the long rains declining is associated with a La Nina-like pattern of sea surface temperature trend over the Pacific Ocean, yet whether it arises from natural climate variability or anthropogenic forcing is still in debate.</p>

          <p>To understand the declining trend, we examined the East African long rains using a century-long observations and climate model outputs.
          We revealed that the recent drying trend in East Africa is mainly attributed to the natural variability of the long rains on decadal or longer time scales.
          The driver of this variability is the sea surface temperature anomaly over the Pacific Ocean, with the La Nina-like pattern corresponding to the dry phase of the long rains.</p>


          <p>We also addressed the fundamental issue of why East Africa is dry and proposed that it can be attributed to the cool air ventilated from the western Indian Ocean, where the sea surface temperature (SST) is low.
          However, we noticed that most state-of-the-art climate models tend to have a systematic bias in simulating the Indian Ocean SST, which leads to underestimating the long rains while overestimating the short rains in East Africa.
          This casts large uncertainty to the projection of future hydroclimate in this region.<p>

          </div>
		  
          <p>Due to the self rotation of the Earth, the three-dimensional atmospheric circulation is actually dominated by the zonal (east-west) component, therefore an accurate analysis of the zonal momentum budget is crucial in understanding how the atmospheric circulation works, and a good representation of zonal momentum dynamics is important in climate modeling.
          By analyzing the zonal momentum budget from the reanalysis, a quasi-observational dataset, we found the zonal-mean equatorial upper-troposphere easterlies are maintained by the advection of the absolute angular momentum associated with the cross-equatorial Hadley circulation.
          However, the pressure gradient force also plays an important role in regional longitudes, e.g. the Asian monsoon region.</p>
